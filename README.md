#                             JS - tagifier

## A free (and pure) solution for instant/live  HTML text  field analysis, modification, & replacement.


 This is something like a "keyword highlighter" for html/text fields, but its
 designed originally and foremost to extract #hash_tags from user input as 
 they type. It is pure JavaScript, no third party dependencies. 

 We use a special type of html text input/field that's just a regular element 
 with the attribute "contenteditable" set like so:


     <div contenteditable id="MyText">dream eternal</div>

see: tagifier.js for more details.
